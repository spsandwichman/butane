TODO:
    - just fucking restructure everything
    
    
    - figure out object-space vs world-space interoperability
        - are object-space vertex tables useful? maybe by default the vertex table should be defined in world-space
            - could keep an object-space table around for reference if a function really needed one
        - honestly at this point just restructure the Object class, i was being stupid when i made it
