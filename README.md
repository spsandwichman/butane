# Butane

Absolutely horrendous 3d graphics library. Currently incomplete and far from functional.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, my code is terrible.

## License

[0BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD). I don't expect anybody to use this ever, but if you do, use it however you want, no credit needed. Feel free to let me know though, it would make my day :D

Note: Butane, as it is right now, uses libraries which may be covered under different licenses. I do plan to phase these out once Butane reaches a certain level of structure.
