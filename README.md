# Butane

Absolutely horrendously coded 3d renderer. Currently incomplete and far from functional.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, my code is terrible.

[0BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD). I don't expect anybody to use any part of this ever, but if you do, use it however you want, no credit needed. Feel free to let me know though, it would make my day :D

Note: Butane, as it is right now, uses libraries which may be covered under different licenses. I do plan to phase these out once Butane reaches a certain level of structure.
